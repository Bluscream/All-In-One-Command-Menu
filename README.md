# All-In-One-Command-Menu
By Leopard20
________
This is a remake of the popular -but sadly abandoned- WW AI Menu mod for ARMA 3 by WindWalking, with lots of improvements and new features!

# Want to contribute?
You can contribute to the project by:
1. Fixing bugs and making pull requests
2. Submitting issues and bugs
3. Submitting feature requests

Fixing bugs is always welcome! If you want to add a new feature yourself, be sure to:
1. Remember the limitations of the mod. This mod uses simple CommandingMenus and not all features can be implemented.
2. Create a Feature Request in the issues section, and mention the changes you want to make.
3. Make minimal changes to the original scripts (those made by WindWalking)
