# Want to contribute?
You can contribute to the project by:
* Fixing bugs and making pull requests
* Submitting issues and bugs
* Submitting feature requests

Fixing bugs is always welcome! If you want to add a new feature yourself, be sure to:
* Remember the limitations of the mod. This mod uses simple CommandingMenus and not all features can be implemented.
* Create a Feature Request in the issues section, and mention the changes you want to make.
* Make minimal changes to the original scripts (those made by WindWalking)

# Build Instructions:
**Required Tools:**
ARMA Tools

**Build Steps:**
Building is fairly straight-forward and no different than making other ARMA mods.
1. Convert the folder `AIO_AIMENU` to .pbo using ARMA Tools.
2. Create a folder called `@AIO_AIMenu`, and inside this folder create another folder called `addons`.
3. Place the .pbo file inside the `addons` folder.
4. Move the `@AIO_AIMENU` folder to your ARMA 3 installation directory.
